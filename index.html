        <h3>life must go on</h3>
        <P>Life is like a roller coaster ride, sometimes you close your eyes and hold on in sheer terror and other times, you have to raise your hand up in the air and enjoy the ride; it has its own ups and downs but the choice is ours to scream or enjoy the ride. Life is the best teacher and an excellent guide. Every struggle, every adventure, every loss, every feat, and all the experience give significant knowledge. So, no matter what life throws at us, we should believe in ourselves and take up the lesson and move on to the next chapter of life. Everything happens for a reason; we just can learn to let go and should believe that things fall apart so better things can fall together.</P>
